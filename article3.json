        "text": "In the digital age, technology has become an integral part of our lives. While it offers numerous benefits, it also contributes to the rise in mental health issues, particularly depression. Social media, constant connectivity, and information overload have created an environment where people are more vulnerable to mental health challenges than ever before."

        "text": "Depression in the digital age is often exacerbated by the pressure to present a perfect image on social media. Studies show that excessive use of social media can increase feelings of isolation, inadequacy, and anxiety, all of which can contribute to the development or worsening of depression."

        "text": "Some signs that depression may be linked to digital habits include frequent social media comparison, spending excessive time online, and feeling drained after online interactions. The constant exposure to others' curated lives can create unrealistic expectations, leading to negative self-perception and low self-esteem."

      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "Another contributing factor is the addiction to digital devices. Constant notifications and the need to check emails or social media can disrupt sleep patterns, making it harder for individuals to rest and recharge. This can worsen the symptoms of depression and lead to a vicious cycle of mental health decline."

        "text": "To manage depression in the digital age, it's crucial to establish healthy boundaries with technology. One effective strategy is setting aside time each day for a digital detox. This could involve turning off notifications, limiting social media use, or designating 'screen-free' zones to give your mind a break from constant stimulation."

        "text": "In addition to digital boundaries, seeking professional help is essential for those struggling with depression. Therapy, counseling, and support groups can provide valuable tools for managing depression. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), in particular, has been shown to be effective in helping individuals identify negative thought patterns and develop healthier ways of thinking."
